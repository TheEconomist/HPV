current_cov = coverage in X year

curr_vacc_cohort_size = number vaccinated in that cohort

future_cov = 90% coverage rate

future_vacc_cohort_size = number vaccinated in cohort under new coverage
rate

curr_cc_prev: cervical cancer cases prevented under the current coverage

curr_mort_prev: deaths from cervical cancer prevented under the current
coverage

curr_cost: current cost of the program

curr_cost_prev: current costs prevented by reducing cervical cancer

proj_cc_prev, proj_mort_prev, proj_cost, proj_cost_prev are the same as
above but under the "projected" 90% coverage rate the WHO says is
necessary for elimination of cervical cancer
